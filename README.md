## üí´ Pro Tips

1. **Quick Access**
   - Create an alias in your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`:

## üéØ Creating a Dock Application (macOS)

You can create a clickable application icon for your Dock:

1. Open **Automator**
2. Create a new **Application**
3. Add a "Run Shell Script" action and paste this code:

```applescript
# Run Terminal with our script
osascript <<EOF
tell application "Terminal"
    activate
    do script "\"$HOME/Documents/codeprojects/upbrew/upbrew.sh\""
    delay 1
    repeat
        if not busy of window 1 then
            delay 2
            close window 1
            exit repeat
        end if
        delay 1
    end repeat
end tell
EOF
```

4. Save as "UpBrew.app" in your desired location
5. To use the custom icon:
   - Right-click UpBrew.app > Get Info
   - Drag `icon.icns` onto the icon in the top-left corner
6. Drag UpBrew.app to your Dock

Now you can run your Homebrew maintenance with a single click! The Terminal window will open, run the script, and close automatically when finished.
```
